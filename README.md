# Jacob Kurian — Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

## Quick start

1. Extract the ZIP into a folder.
2. Open a terminal inside the folder.
3. Run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:3000 if the browser doesn't open automatically.

Notes:
- Resume is available as `/JacobKurian_Resume.pdf` and the site's download buttons point to it.
- Tailwind is already configured (run `npm install` to install the dev deps).
- To deploy to Vercel: connect the repo and set build command `npm run build` (Vercel will handle install).
